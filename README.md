Conclusion:
Degree & Occupation vs. Bike Purchased
People with higher education levels (Graduate Degrees, Bachelors) and professional occupations tend to purchase bikes more frequently.
Manual and clerical workers have comparatively lower bike purchases.

Region-wise Distribution
North America has the highest number of bike purchases, followed by Europe and Pacific.
This could be due to better biking infrastructure, cultural preferences, or economic factors.

Age Group-wise Distribution
Middle-aged individuals purchase bikes the most, while adolescents and older individuals show lower bike purchases.
This might indicate that people in this age group use bikes for commuting or fitness purposes.

Purchased Bike vs. Distance
People commuting 0-1 miles and 1-2 miles tend to purchase bikes more frequently.
As distance increases beyond 5 miles, bike purchases decline significantly.

Males tend to purchase bikes slightly more than females, but the difference is not very large.
